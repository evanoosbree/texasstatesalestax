    <h2>How Texas State and Local Sales Tax Work</h2>
    <p>
      Texas is a destination-based sales tax state. The state portion of the
      sales and use tax is <strong>6.25%</strong> everywhere. Local jurisdictions
      (cities, counties, special-purpose districts and transit authorities) can
      each levy additional sales and use taxes, but the total local portion is
      capped at <strong>2%</strong>. That means the combined rate you pay at the
      register can range from <strong>6.25%</strong> up to a maximum of
      <strong>8.25%</strong> depending on where the sale is sourced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this, two addresses in the same metro area can have slightly
      different combined rates. Merchants and remote sellers should always verify
      the correct rate using the state’s official <em>Sales Tax Rate Locator</em>
      before collecting or filing.

      The sections below give high-level overviews for major Texas metro areas.
      They all share the same state rate (6.25%), but local city, county,

        <h3>Dallas sales tax overview</h3>
        <p>
          Taxable sales in the Dallas area are subject to the statewide
          <strong>6.25%</strong> Texas sales tax plus applicable local city,
          county, transit and special district taxes. Many addresses in the City
          of Dallas reach the maximum combined rate of <strong>8.25%</strong>,

        <h3>Houston sales tax overview</h3>
        <p>
          In the Houston metro, the state’s 6.25% rate applies to most taxable
          retail sales, and local jurisdictions may add up to 2% in additional
          tax. Addresses inside the city limits often reach the combined cap,
          while locations in surrounding counties can reflect different local
          combinations.

      <article class="city-section" id="austin-sales-tax">
        <h3>Austin sales tax overview</h3>
        <p>
          Austin-area sellers collect the Texas state sales tax and any local
          sales and use taxes that apply at the place of business or delivery.
          The combined rate in many Austin addresses reaches 8.25%, but rates
          can vary in neighboring communities and special-purpose districts.

        <h3>San Antonio sales tax overview</h3>
        <p>
          San Antonio transactions generally include the 6.25% state portion
          plus city, county, transit and possibly special district tax up to the
          2% local cap. Businesses that ship or deliver within the metro should
          verify the correct local rate for each delivery address.

          Fort Worth uses the statewide 6.25% sales tax and one or more local
          jurisdiction rates, up to a maximum combined rate of 8.25%. Addresses
          in Tarrant County outside of the Fort Worth city limits can fall under
          different local combinations and should be checked individually.

        <h3>El Paso sales tax overview</h3>
        <p>
          El Paso businesses collect the 6.25% state tax and local sales and use
          taxes that apply within city and county boundaries. Combined rates
          commonly approach the statewide maximum of 8.25%, but specific
          addresses should still be verified through the Comptroller’s tools.

        <p>
          Suburbs such as Plano, Frisco, McKinney and Allen layer local sales
          and use taxes on top of the 6.25% state rate. Many addresses reach the
          8.25% cap, but overlapping special-purpose and transit districts mean
          that even nearby locations can differ slightly.

  <section class="card" id="faq">
    <h2>Texas Sales Tax FAQs</h2>
    <h3>Is there a separate Texas use tax?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Texas imposes a complementary use tax at the same rates as the sales
      tax when taxable items are purchased without paying the correct Texas tax
      at the time of sale (for example, items shipped in from out of state).
    </p>

    <h3>Are groceries and medicine taxable in Texas?</h3>
    <p>
      Most unprepared food for home consumption and many prescription medicines
      are exempt from Texas state and local sales and use tax. However, prepared
      food, restaurant meals and many over-the-counter items remain taxable.
    </p>

    <h3>Where can I find official Texas sales tax guidance?</h3>
    <p>
      The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts provides official rules,
      publications and online tools for rate lookup, permitting and filing
      returns. Always rely on those resources when you have compliance
      questions.
