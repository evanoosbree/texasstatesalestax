    <section id="overview">
      <h2>1. Quick overview</h2>
      <p>
        Texas charges a statewide sales and use tax on most retail sales of goods and many services.
        On top of that, cities, counties, transit authorities, and special-purpose districts can add local sales tax.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>State sales tax rate:</strong> <strong>6.25%</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Local sales tax:</strong> up to an additional <strong>2.00%</strong> total</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum combined rate:</strong> <strong>8.25%</strong> (state + all local)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That means every taxable purchase in Texas will have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>at least</strong> 6.25% tax, and</li>
        <li><strong>at most</strong> 8.25% tax, depending on where the sale is sourced.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Some items (like most groceries and prescription medicines) are exempt from Texas state sales tax.
        Not everything you buy will be taxed, and some categories have special rules.

    </section>

    <section id="current-rates">
      <h2>2. Current Texas sales tax rates (2025)</h2>

      <h3>2.1 State rate</h3>
      <p>
        The statewide Texas sales and use tax rate is <strong>6.25%</strong>. This has been the base state rate for many years.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Local rates and combined range</h3>
      <p>
        Local jurisdictions in Texas (cities, counties, special-purpose districts, and transit authorities) can each add their own sales and use tax,
        up to a combined local cap of <strong>2.00%</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means the <strong>combined state + local rate</strong across Texas ranges roughly from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>6.25%</strong> (state only, no local tax)</li>
        <li>up to <strong>8.25%</strong> (6.25% state + 2.00% local)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Example combined rates</h3>
      <p>Here are typical combined rates you’ll see in many Texas locations:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Location (example)</th>
            <th>State</th>
            <th>Local</th>
            <th>Total sales tax</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Small town with no local tax</td>
            <td>6.25%</td>
            <td>0.00%</td>
            <td><strong>6.25%</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>City with 1.00% city + 1.00% county</td>
            <td>6.25%</td>
            <td>2.00%</td>
            <td><strong>8.25%</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>City with 1.50% mixed local</td>
            <td>6.25%</td>
            <td>1.50%</td>
            <td><strong>7.75%</strong></td>
          </tr>

      <h2>3. How to calculate Texas sales tax (with examples)</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Basic formula</h3>
      <p>
        The basic formula for calculating Texas sales tax on a purchase is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>Sales tax = Item price × Tax rate</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The tax rate you use is the combined state + local rate for where the sale is sourced (usually where the buyer takes possession).
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Example: 8.25% total rate</h3>
      <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You buy a taxable item for $100 in a location with an 8.25% combined rate.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Item price: $100.00</li>
        <li>Tax rate: 8.25% = 0.0825</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <code>Sales tax = 100 × 0.0825 = 8.25</code>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Total you pay: $108.25</strong></p>

      <h3>3.3 Example: 6.25% state-only rate</h3>
      <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You buy a taxable item for $50 in an area with no local tax.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Item price: $50.00</li>
        <li>Tax rate: 6.25% = 0.0625</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <code>Sales tax = 50 × 0.0625 = 3.125 → $3.13 (rounded)</code>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Total you pay: $53.13</strong></p>

      <h3>3.4 Quick mental math tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>At <strong>8.25%</strong>, tax is a bit less than <strong>an extra 1/12</strong> of the price.</li>
        <li>At <strong>6.25%</strong>, tax is a bit more than <strong>1/16</strong> of the price.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="local">
      <h2>4. State vs local tax & the 8.25% maximum rule</h2>

      <h3>4.1 State tax (6.25%)</h3>
      <p>
        The 6.25% state sales and use tax applies to most taxable transactions in Texas. This portion goes to the state government.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Local tax (up to 2.00%)</h3>
      <p>
        Local jurisdictions can add their own sales and use tax, up to a combined local cap of 2%. That 2% can be made up of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>City sales tax</li>
        <li>County sales tax</li>
        <li>Transit authority tax</li>
        <li>Special-purpose district taxes</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Maximum total of 8.25%</h3>
      <p>
        No matter how many local jurisdictions apply, the combined rate (state + all local) for sales and use tax on a given transaction cannot exceed <strong>8.25%</strong>.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Example:</strong> If a city already has 2.00% in local sales tax, a new special-purpose district cannot add another 0.25% on top of that for local sales tax on general goods in that area, because it would exceed the 8.25% combined cap.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="exemptions">
      <h2>5. Common exemptions & special cases</h2>

      <h3>5.1 Items often exempt from Texas sales tax</h3>
      <p>
        Texas exempts certain categories from sales tax. Some of the more common ones include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most <strong>groceries</strong> and unprepared food</li>
        <li><strong>Prescription</strong> medicines</li>
        <li>Many <strong>over-the-counter medicines</strong></li>
        <li>Certain <strong>medical devices</strong> and supplies</li>
        <li>Some purchases by qualifying nonprofits or government entities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Details can be technical, so businesses usually check the Texas Comptroller’s guidance or consult a tax professional before assuming an item is exempt.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Motor vehicles & boats</h3>
      <p>
        Motor vehicles and boats are handled under special Texas rules; they’re generally taxed at the state rate (6.25%) with separate registration and titling processes.
        Local add-ons work differently than with ordinary retail sales, and there can be separate fees.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 Occasional sales & resale</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resale:</strong> If you buy items strictly to resell them and you hold a valid Texas sales tax permit, you usually give your supplier a resale certificate and do not pay tax at the time of purchase. You then collect tax when you sell to your customer.</li>
        <li><strong>Occasional sales:</strong> One-off or casual sales between individuals sometimes fall under “occasional sale” rules; these can be exempt if the legal requirements are met.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="online">
      <h2>6. Online & out-of-state sellers</h2>

      <h3>6.1 Economic nexus threshold</h3>
      <p>
        Texas, like many states, has an “economic nexus” rule for remote (out-of-state) sellers. Once a remote seller exceeds a certain amount of sales into Texas (for example, a threshold based on yearly revenue), they may have to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Register for a Texas sales tax permit</li>
        <li>Collect Texas sales and use tax on orders shipped to Texas customers</li>
        <li>File periodic sales tax returns and remit the tax</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6.2 Local tax & remote sellers</h3>
      <p>
        Texas allows certain remote sellers to use a special “single local use tax rate” instead of calculating the exact local rate for every address. This is a simplifying option for qualifying remote sellers so they don’t have to track each local rate individually.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        If you sell into Texas from out of state (for example through an online store), talk with a tax professional or check directly with the Texas Comptroller to see whether you’ve crossed the economic nexus threshold and how you should handle local tax.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="lookup">
      <h2>7. How to look up the exact rate for your address</h2>
      <p>
        Because local sales tax changes from city to city (and even within some ZIP codes), it’s best to look up the precise rate for your location.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find the exact combined rate for a location in Texas, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Texas Comptroller’s official online tax rate lookup tools</li>
        <li>Check recent notices from your city or county about local sales tax changes</li>
        <li>Use reputable third-party calculators that track current state and local rates</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For official reporting, always rely on the Comptroller’s guidance and published rates.

      <h2>8. Fast FAQ: Texas sales tax questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is there a Texas state income tax?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Texas does not have a state personal income tax. Instead, the state relies more heavily on sales tax and property tax for revenue.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the current Texas state sales tax rate?</h3>
        <p>
          The current statewide Texas sales and use tax rate is <strong>6.25%</strong>. Local jurisdictions can add up to an additional 2.00%, for a maximum combined rate of <strong>8.25%</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does the tax rate change from city to city?</h3>
        <p>
          Each local jurisdiction (cities, counties, transit authorities, and special-purpose districts) can choose to impose its own sales and use tax, within state limits. That’s why your combined rate can be 6.25% in one place and 8.25% in another.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do online purchases get Texas sales tax?</h3>
        <p>
          Many online purchases shipped to Texas will include Texas sales tax, especially if the seller has a physical presence in Texas or meets the economic nexus threshold. Some marketplaces and large online retailers collect and remit Texas sales tax automatically.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I be sure I’m charging the right tax rate to my customers?</h3>
        <p>
          The safest approach is to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the Texas Comptroller’s official tools to find your location’s rate</li>
          <li>Keep your address and tax settings up to date in your point-of-sale or e-commerce system</li>
          <li>Work with a tax professional if you have complex situations (multiple locations, online sales, large volume, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
